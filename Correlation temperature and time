#We used pingouin scientific library to estimate correlation between 2 numeric variables ("time" and "temperature"). Since we assume unlinear relationship between variables, we performed Spearman correlation. Data were checked for normality using omnibus normality test. We have found 2 statistically small negative correlations between: -0.29 - 0.09 (r = -0.103, p > 0.05). Multiple comparions test (Bonferonni) was performed to decrease the possibility of type I error. Adjusted p-values are in Table 4. The scatterplot is presented by img. 1, the heatmap - img. 2.
